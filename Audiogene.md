## Benefits

* Using Rails framework instead of CakePHP is more robust and easier to implement 

## Existing Components

* Some Javascript (Needs to be determine if itâ€™s useful or not)
    * Ex. Visualization - Currently Hardcoded (Needs to come from database)

## Features 
* Having both interactive 3D and 2D audio profiles into one page 
* Adding links to DVD site and 2D plots 
* Adding curation site 
* Adding view of database information
* Login site 
    * Generate sessions for android app that expires 
* Interactive w/ Android application 

## Overall 
* Refactor the backend (currently runs on CakePHP)
* Database - Maria (mysql)
